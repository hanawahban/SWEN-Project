# SWEN-Project
## Project Description

**Unipool** is a university-based carpooling application designed to connect students who share similar routes, offering a more convenient, cost-effective, and sustainable mode of transportation.  
The app allows students to either **offer rides as drivers** or **book available rides as passengers**, all within the same academic community.

Unipool focuses on creating a **safe**, **user-friendly**, and **socially connected** platform. It includes features such as driver and rider ratings, real-time ride tracking, in-app chat, and a rewards system that encourages active participation and trust among users.

### Purpose and Goals

The main goal of Unipool is to **reduce transportation costs and environmental impact** while **enhancing social interaction** among university students.

By enabling shared rides, the app aims to:
- Minimize the number of vehicles on campus.
- Help students save money on daily commutes.
- Foster a sense of community through shared travel.
- Provide a reliable and transparent system for managing rides and ensuring user safety.

### Core Features

#### For Drivers
- Accept nearby ride requests easily.  
- View rider profiles and ratings before accepting.  
- Communicate directly with riders through in-app chat.  
- Track passenger pickup locations using live GPS.  
- Receive notifications for ride requests, updates, and cancellations.  
- Earn ratings and feedback from riders.  
- Access incentives and rewards for consistent performance.  

#### For Riders
- Find and book nearby available drivers.  
- View driver ratings, car types, and details before booking.  
- Chat directly with drivers to confirm pickup details.  
- Split ride costs fairly with other passengers.  
- Track the driver’s live location during the trip.  
- Receive real-time ride notifications and alerts.  
- Add trusted drivers or passengers to a friends list.  
- Earn reward points for frequent app use.  
- Provide feedback and rate drivers after each trip.

### System Overview

Unipool’s architecture is centered around **two primary user roles — Driver and Rider** — both interacting through a shared backend that manages:
- Authentication  
- Ride listings and availability  
- Notifications and live tracking  
- Data synchronization across users  

**Planned Technologies:**
- **Frontend:** FlutterFlow (for rapid UI prototyping and cross-platform support)  
- **Backend:** Firebase (for authentication, database, and real-time updates)  
- **Design:** Figma (for wireframes, UI mockups, and page layouts)  

---

### Design and Planning Artifacts

The Unipool project followed an **agile approach** with clear documentation and iterative design improvements.

**Artifacts include:**
- User Stories for Drivers and Riders  
- UML Diagrams (Use Case, Activity, Sequence, Class, and State)  
- System Architecture Diagram  
- Wireframes and UI Mockups in Figma  

These deliverables guided the identification of system requirements, interactions, and early design structures.

### Development Approach

The project was managed using **Agile methodologies**, emphasizing collaboration, iteration, and continuous improvement.

**Key Practices:**
- **Biweekly Standups:** Held every Sunday and Thursday at 12:40 PM.  
- **Kanban Boards:** Used to track progress through Backlog → Selected → Analysis → Development → Testing → Done.  
- **Version Control:** All work is tracked through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hanawahban/SWEN-Project).  
- **Collaborative Workflows:** Team members contribute commits and updates regularly to maintain visibility and version consistency.  

Currently, the project has completed the **requirements analysis and initial system design** phase and is preparing to transition into **implementation**.

### Summary

Unipool represents an early-stage design and planning effort for a student carpooling platform built with an agile mindset.  
It combines functionality, usability, and sustainability goals into a single project that supports both community connection and environmental responsibility.
